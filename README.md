# ❤️ Heart Disease Predictive Model

This project is a web-based **Heart Disease Prediction System** built using **FastAPI** for the backend and a **React** frontend. The model predicts the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on certain medical features. 

## 🚀 Features

- **Heart Disease Prediction**: Predict the likelihood of having heart disease based on medical features like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc. 🩺
- **Frontend**: Built with React for a dynamic and responsive user interface. 🎨
- **Backend**: The backend is built with FastAPI to handle prediction requests. ⚙️
- **Model**: The machine learning model is trained on a dataset of heart disease cases and outputs predictions based on the user's inputs. 🧠
- **CORS Support**: Enabled for cross-origin requests, allowing seamless interaction between the frontend and backend. 🌐
