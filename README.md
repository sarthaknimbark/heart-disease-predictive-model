# Heart Disease Predictive Model

This project is a web-based heart disease prediction system built using **FastAPI** for the backend and a **React** frontend. The model predicts the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on certain medical features. The application allows users to input their medical data and receive a prediction.

## Features

- **Heart Disease Prediction**: Predict the likelihood of having heart disease based on medical features like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.
- **Frontend**: Built with React for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: The backend is built with FastAPI to handle the prediction requests.
- **Model**: The machine learning model is trained on a dataset of heart disease cases, and it outputs the prediction based on the user's inputs.
- **CORS support**: Enabled for cross-origin requests, allowing seamless interaction between the frontend and backend.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - React
  - Material UI
  - Tailwind CSS (for styling)

- **Backend**:
  - FastAPI
  - Python
  - joblib (for model loading and predictions)
  - Numpy
  - Pydantic (for validation)

- **Model**:
  - Machine Learning Model (you can include details about the model, e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)
